# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to detect Parkinson’s disease in patients using a supervised machine learning model built with Python. The model is trained on a biomedical voice measurement dataset and uses an SVM classifier to predict the likelihood of Parkinson’s based on vocal features.
